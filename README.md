# Family-Relations

![Alt text for the image](pro.jpg)

## Overview
The "Family-Relations" project is a Prolog-based application designed to explore and demonstrate various family relationships. It uses Prolog's logical programming capabilities to define and query relationships such as parent, grandparent, sister, and aunt.

## Repository Structure
- [app.pl](https://github.com/AbdullahAlzeid/Family-Relations/blob/main/app.pl): The main Prolog application file containing the logic for defining family relationships.
- **Report**: Contains a detailed report of the script results.
  - [ICS381- Prolog.pdf](https://github.com/AbdullahAlzeid/Family-Relations/blob/main/Report/ICS381-%20Prolog.pdf): A PDF document explaining the script in detail.
- [LICENSE](https://github.com/AbdullahAlzeid/Family-Relations/blob/main/LICENSE): The license file.
- [README.md](https://github.com/AbdullahAlzeid/Family-Relations/blob/main/README.md): The README file.

## Key Features
- **Family Relationship Definitions**: Defines basic family relationships like parent, grandparent, and siblings.
- **Logical Queries**: Allows querying the family tree to find relationships between members.
- **Prolog Implementation**: Showcases the use of Prolog for logical and relational queries.

## How to Run
To run the application:
1. Ensure you have a Prolog interpreter installed.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run the `app.pl` file using your Prolog interpreter.
